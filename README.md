# hey that's kind of neat it lets you edit right here.  ok i am starting to get the hang of this.  now i need a source of income so i can continue learning as a computer scientist.  i have theoretically enough money for a few months.  and if i schedule the time in i can get through kaggle, as well as w3.  and then hopefully be somewhere on kaggle.  meanwhile i should be adding to repositories on github and start building my world but encoded.

# like lion could actually be something else periphery, like leopold.  and snake could be python, the language itself, as the caduceus.  an ancient lore pointing to the modern expression.

# well this is fun i am just commenting this readme out like a mofo.  lets leave one line of encrypted code for someone to run if they so chose to run the read me...

# it could be like print(encrypted code unencrypted.  or 80085 print(80000 + 85)
# thats pretty funny my first code prank
print(80000+85)
